Description: A program to characterize 3' Untranslated Region variants by their
    potential regulatory elements. Takes as input canonical 3'UTR variants in a variant call file.
    Gives as output the variant alternatively polyadenylated isoform location; whether the variant 
    is in an enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) peak, microRNA site, or RNA binding 
    protein motif; any nearby ClinVar, expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL), or genome wide 
    association study (GWAS) variants; and whether the variant is predicted to be an eQTL or GWAS 
    variant.
